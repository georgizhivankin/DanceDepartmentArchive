# Dance Department Archive Script for Winamp

# About the script

The Dance Department archive script is a small script written in PHP and HTML that generates dynamic .M3U playlist files containing the latest two episodes of the popular Dutch electronic dance music show [Dance Department](http://www.538.nl/programma/45/dance-department-1) that broadcasts live each Saturday night between 20:00 and 00:00 CET (GMT +1:00) on [Radio 538](http://www.radio538.nl/).
The file generation happens when the script is first loaded into the user's browser and then links to the generated playlist files are being inserted into the HTML page where the user could open them using a standard media player that supports .M3U playlists. 

The purpose of this script is to allow the users to listen to the archived Dance Department episodes with their favourite media player, instead of having to use the official Radio 538 Flash-based Player that is available on the Dance Department website.

* Note that the content generated by this script is provided by Radio 538 as is, and I am just reusing their own publically available addresses to generate the files with, and I am not providing, distributing, selling or somehow modifying the original source files in any way, share or form. Neither do I guarantee their availability or reliability.

## Requirements
